## Developers

### Commitizen-friendly:
Commits to this repository must adhere to the conventional-changelog convention, commitizen will help make sure of that by prompting for missing information on commit messages.
Please install the tool globally and use cz instead of git commit when committing changes.

### commitlint
When using the default git commit, commitlint will generate errors to make sure the convention is followed.
